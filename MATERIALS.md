## Materials

### Diodes

Diodes made from organic molecules like Alq3.

- organo-metallic chelates are commonly used
- they have high

## Alq3: Chemical Properties

- high thermal stability
- high quantum yield of fluorescence
- high electron transport ability

### Thermal Stability

Ability of a polymer to resist heat and maintain its strength, toughness and elasticity.

### Quantum Yield

Number of times a specific event occurs per photon absorbed by Alq3.

For fluorescence, it tells us:

```math
FQY = photons absorbed / photons emitted
```

- this is important for transforming electrons (electricity) into light (photons)

### Electron Transport Ability

More of a biological thing.

### Denticity

Number of donor groups in a single ligand. A hooker with a single bond to its central atom is a monodentate ligand.

- Alq3 is bidentate. Just like Oxaliplatin, with two Am bonds to its left ligand and two Oxy bonds to its right ligand.
- Usually, a metal is the central atom since it has a high valence capacity

## OLED Architecture

We have either BEOLED or TEOLED.

- beoled is bottom emitting. Light has to travel through pixel drive circuits (TFT substrate)
- teoled is top emitting. The light generated can be extracted efficiently
